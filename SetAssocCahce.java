/*
 * Set Assoc Cache: Like a row of lockers, but each locker is a set of spaces that can hold a few unique items with unique ids
 * less collisions
 * need a 2 set (2 way) and a 4 set (4 way)
 * 2KB, 2-way set associative, 1-word blocks
 2KB, 4-way set associative, 1-word blocks
 2KB, 4-way set associative, 4-word blocks

 Use the following 2 data files for your testing.  Each file contains 5 million memory reference addresses taken from actual running programs.  

Each line of the file contains a single 32-bit memory reference address.
Work with each address as an integer - (25% grade deduction - DO NOT store addresses as strings, array of chars, or array of individual bits)
Your code should be reasonably fast (less than 10-15 seconds on your local computer)
