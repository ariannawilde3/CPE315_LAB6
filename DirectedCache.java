/*
 *Directed Cache: is like a row of lockers with specific locker numbers
 each locker can hold one unique item with a unique item ID
 to find where it is placed you do add / id %2
 if there is a collision replace item 

 2KB, direct mapped, 1-word blocks
 2KB, direct mapped, 2-word blocks
 2KB, direct mapped, 4-word blocks
 4KB, direct mapped, 1-word blocks

Use the following 2 data files for your testing.  Each file contains 5 million memory reference addresses taken from actual running programs.  

Each line of the file contains a single 32-bit memory reference address.
Work with each address as an integer - (25% grade deduction - DO NOT store addresses as strings, array of chars, or array of individual bits)
Your code should be reasonably fast (less than 10-15 seconds on your local computer)
